<h1><strong><u>Brewery:</u></strong></h1>
<p>Brewery allows players to create both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>The drinks on the server are completely custom with only a few keeping their original recipes, but the number of drinks has been greatly expanded.<br>Some image assets were used from the Original Brewery Wiki Here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/wiki">Link</a></p>
<h2><u>Fermenting:</u></h2>
<div class="markdown-heading"><a class="anchor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/wiki/Usage#fermenting" id="user-content-fermenting" aria-label="Permalink: Fermenting"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewbox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"></svg></a></div>
<p>Step one consists of Fermenting the fresh Ingredients.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Place a Cauldron over a fire or other heat source.</li>
    <li>Fill it with water.</li>
    <li>Add Ingredients with a right-click.</li>
    <li>Wait a few minutes (specified by recipe) while they ferment.</li>
    <li>Fill in glass bottles.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Hint:</u></strong> <i>Use a clock on a cauldron, if you want to know the time the ingredients have been fermenting.</i></p>

<p>Some recipes don't need distilling.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Put the bottle with ferment into the brewing stand</li>
    <li>Put glowstone dust as a filter on top of the brewing stand (The filter will not be consumed)</li>

    <h2><u>Ageing:</u></h2><a class="anchor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/wiki/Usage#aging" id="user-content-aging" aria-label="Permalink: Aging"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewbox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"></svg></a>
</div>
<p>A barrel is needed for ageing. You get different types (Wood Types) of barrels and different drinks will require different barrels to age in. The will be shown below and how to make them.</p>
<p><strong>Minecraft Barrel</strong> | <i>6 Slots | <strong><u>Oak</u></strong></i></p>
<p>Simply craft and place the barrel and put the brews inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><strong>Small barrel</strong> | <i>9 Slots | <strong><u>All Wood Types Supported</u></strong></i></p>
<p>Use 8 wooden stairs to build a barrel shape.<br>Place a sign on the lower right side and write "Barrel" in the upper Line.</p>
<p><img class="image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:1920/1001;width:50.6%;" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eb8b7ca25bbc13194400f373e7158b2fc38d9fd93a3a99aa6d1d97f9d0bc5d83/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f754970436678412e706e67" width="1920" height="1001"></p>
<p>If you made it correctly, the barrel should be 2x2 of stairs with the sign, and you will get a message in chat that says “Barrel created”. if not, you went wrong somewhere in the barrel creation.</p>
<p><strong>Big barrel</strong> | <i>27 Slots | <strong><u>All Wood Types Supported</u></strong></i></p>
<p>Use 5 Fences, 16 Wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape. Attach a Spigot (Fence) and a sign that has "Barrel" written on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/106931a5179693500c3f9614bcc2290aa299458b2bb9a10354572d9695dab75f/68747470733a2f2f696d6775722e636f6d2f6b336834716a302e706e67" width="200" height="250"></p>
<p>If you made it correctly, you will get a message in chat that says “Barrel created”. if not, you went wrong somewhere in the barrel creation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Open the Barrel by clicking on it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Put the Bottles into the Barrels for ageing.</li>
    <li>For every Minecraft Day, the brews will age a year.</li>
    <li>Depending on the recipe, the type of wood used for building the barrel may alter the quality of the aged brew.</li>
</ul>
<p>Barrels are protected from other players the same way that all chests are in a protected (claims) area.</p>

</div>
<p>The amount of alcohol inside the brew will be applied to the player when drinking. Depending on the quality of it, that may have different effects.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The player may not be able to walk normally anymore, they will weave, making it almost impossible to walk straight.</li>
    <li>Effects like blindness, confusion, poison etc. occur.</li>
    <li>The Chat will be altered depending on drunkenness. Many things players write may be incomprehensible, sometimes it may seem senseless.</li>
    <li>If alcohol is particularly strong, it may have poisonous effects.</li>
    <li>After drinking a lot, there is a chance of vomiting.</li>
    <li>When logging off, the player may have difficulties reaching his character, thus some logins shortly after may be denied.</li>
    <li>After over-drinking, the player may faint (disconnecting from the server and being unable to reconnect for a short while).</li>

    <h2><u>Brew Sealing - for shops:</u></h2><a class="anchor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/wiki/Usage#brew-sealing---for-shop-plugins" id="user-content-brew-sealing---for-shop-plugins" aria-label="Permalink: Brew Sealing - for shop plugins"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewbox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"></svg></a>
</div>
<p>You can just give your created brews to other players, and they might even put them back into a barrel to keep ageing them. But the Shop plugin requires sold items to be exactly equal and this is where sealing comes in. Imagine it like putting a seal on a bottle.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To sell Brews in Shops, you will need to seal them using the Brew Sealing Table.</li>
    <li>It is crafted with 2 bottles over 4 planks</li>
    <li>Putting a brew into the Sealing table will equalize it, making it equal to other brews that have been brewed similarly.</li>
    <li>Sealed Brews cannot be aged or modified any further, and they don't show their details anymore.</li>
</ul>

<p>After drinking it takes a while until the alcohol is completely gone. During that time, the alcohol level is steadily decreasing. Also, it can be decreased through consuming certain drinks and food.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Bread - Removes 4 Drunkness</li>
    <li>Milk - Removes 2 Drunkness</li>
    <li>Honey - Removes 3 Drunkness</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>When logging off extremely drunk, it may happen that, if the player logs back in after a while, they may find themselves at a completely unknown place in the middle of nowhere having no idea how they got there.</li>
    <li>But if they log back in after some hours or the next morning, they will find themselves at they're primary home, again without any memories.</li>
    <li>Also, if the alcohol is not of the best quality, the player may face some bad type of hangover effects (slowness and hunger).</li>
</ul>
