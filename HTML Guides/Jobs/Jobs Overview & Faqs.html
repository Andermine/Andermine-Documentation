<h1><u>Jobs Reborn:</u></h1>
<p>Jobs are one of the few ways to make money on the server aside from owning a shop. It's an easy way to make money as long as you take a job that you know you will be doing a lot of, and it is heavily connected to the server ranking system, so as you progress through job levels you will unlock more ranks. Jobs have quests players can complete for rewards which get better with each quest finished for a specific job. Quests are connected to jobs, so will always require you to do something connected to the jobs you chose. Most of the jobs are things you don't have to actively work towards, as you can fulfill the requirements for levels just by playing the game.</p>
<p>Please go to your job page and look at what applies to what jobs, as certain jobs don't get money for blocks that are used in other jobs. if you notice something missing check the FAQ at the end of this page for a reason why, if it is not listed here, please make a report.</p>
