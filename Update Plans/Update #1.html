<p><u><strong>as of 02/03/2024 Rev 5.2</strong></u></p>

<h2><span style="font-size:22px"><u><strong>Server Plan</strong></u></span></h2>

<p><span style="font-size:22px"><u><strong>Revision Colour Index</strong></u></span><br />
<span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Rev 1-3 = <span style="color:#8e44ad">Purple</span><br />
Rev 4 = <span style="color:#2980b9">Blue</span></strong></span><br />
<strong>Rev 5</strong> = <span style="color:#27ae60"><strong>Green</strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>World Generation</strong></u></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60">I&#39;m wiping the slate clean here, I will be using the plugin/mod Terra for all World Generation purposes except for certain structures.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60">The main reasons for this are customizability, ease of use, compatibility and performance. using datapacks has proven to cause massive lag when it comes to world generation. nothing I do can change that except not using them, they&#39;re also harder to modify without breaking something somewhere else and most include their own custom items which cause other headaches as the items don&#39;t register properly with plugins.<br />
<br />
it&#39;s also easier to make sure that the correct world generation is applied to the correct worlds, with datapacks it was a bit hit and miss as they&#39;re not properly supported server side with plugins. and then we get to the second reason, I will be adding Multiverse core or a plugin like it to add a lobby world to the server and later a tutorial world.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60"><span style="font-size:16px"><u><strong>Multiverse</strong></u></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60">Multiverse will be responsible for handling all our new Custom worlds making sure we can include test worlds on the server without having to worry that it will destroy the player&#39;s progress due to loss of inventory, etc. It will also allow us to include both a Lobby world and a Tutorial world.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60"><u><strong>Lobby World</strong></u></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60">The Lobby world will be where the player spawns when they first join the server and they can go visit it agian later by either entering a world portal or using the lobby command which will be implemented. the lobby will have a few fun minigames that can&#39;t be played elsewhere on the server and it will have a separate inventory system from the main world.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60"><u><strong>Tutorial World</strong></u></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60">The tutorial world will be a lot of work, i&#39;m planning on using it to introduce players to some of the harder-to-understand plugins and as a reference guide for all to go back to if they want to look at which features the server has. those that we can&#39;t display easily, will rather have a space available in the tutorial library, where there will be guides that players can use to understand the more complex and vague mechanics included in the server. This will also be where the server&#39;s history will be recorded.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60"><span style="font-size:16px"><u><strong>Terra Config Packs</strong></u></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60"><span style="font-size:14px"><u><strong>Alhinter (Overworld)</strong></u></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60">Alhinter is the overworld Terrapack I will be using and designing, it is a fork of the Origen and Overworld 2.0 Terrapacks and is a pack that merges both and expands upon them. It will include the following when I&#39;m done.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#8e44ad">- Completely custom vanilla biomes, being all the terrain will be reworked to fit the biome better.<br />
- New Custom Trees, This will allow you to find trees as small as vanilla&#39;s most minor but that can also be so large that it covers several chunks with its canopy.<br />
- Custom Overhauled Vanilla Structures, This is because some of the vanilla structures haven&#39;t been updated in years. I want to spice them up and make them somewhat harder while also making them something players will want to explore more often, I am currently thinking of adding different biome variants of certain structures. while also adding more depth to them with archaeology</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60"><span style="font-size:16px"><u><strong>Structures</strong></u></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60">These will be included in the terra config packs, but only the overhauled vanilla structures, any additional structures like wizards towers and large dungeons will be added by the Better Structures Plugin, as it features integration with elitemobs and other plugins which I won&#39;t have if i include them all in the Terra Config.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Menu System</strong></u></span></h3>

<p>The menus will be completely reworked.</p>

<p>They will be reworked as there will be 2 official menu systems on the server.</p>

<p>The Legacy menu system will work like the previous one did, using custom heads for icons.<br />
and the modern system which will use a custom resource pack to render its icons.</p>

<p>The menu system will be expanded heavily to cover as many plugin commands as possible and to streamline it.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Shops &amp; Economy &amp; Spawners</strong></u></span></h3>

<p>The changes here go hand in hand with the new menu system since I will be implementing a custom resource pack for this also, but if the resource pack is missing it&#39;ll show the legacy menu.</p>

<p>Then the server shop will also be supporting multiple currencies The planned currencies will be the ingame $ - dollar, Emeralds and Experience, I&#39;m still working on a plan to balance the three, but I have an idea of how to accomplish that already.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Ranks System</strong></u></span></h3>

<p>The ranks system has been an ongoing project that I would really like to implement, but even with custom rewards it seems that there will not be enough rewards for all the levels, so I&#39;m currently going over all my notes again to completely revamp the rewards, it&#39;ll function as it was planned for to it function but the rewards may be less per level. or some levels just plainly won&#39;t have a reward. That&#39;s all that will be changing here.</p>

<p>The system will be integrated with the profile system. it&#39;ll also integrate with the new mobhunting plugin, so selected ranks will grant you higher rewards.</p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Resource pack</strong></u></span></h3>

<p>The Server resource pack will be rebuilt from the ground up, I&#39;m currently working on it in a private repo on GitHub because I will be creating a multi-version support pack (something only recently introduced by Mojang [1.20.2 ]), I&#39;m looking into making it possible to backport some of the planned features of the pack to older mc versions.</p>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9">The New Java Version of the pack will have the following included.</span></p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9">All Custom Elitemobs Assets.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9">All of the new Menu system Assets.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9">New Custom Textures for the custom fish from Blep Fishing.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9">New Custom Textures for the drinks you make in Brewery.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9">New Custom Textures for all the new custom food items.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9">Yes, I will be looking into Creating a bedrock edition of the resource pack if I get Geysermc to play nice with the other plugins and server systems.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></u></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9">Bug fixes... They&#39;re tricky but here are a few I can confirm have been fixed and how/why they have been fixed.</span></p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9">Enchantments - this has to do with elitemobs enchantments that drove me crazy as I wasn&#39;t able to disable them completely only partially and when you spawned an elite with spawners it would bypass the workaround I had in place, the latest elitemobs update has fixed this</span></li>

<h4><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Feature Changes</strong></u></span></h4>

<h4><span style="font-size:16px"><u><strong>New Features</strong></u></span></h4>

<h4><span style="font-size:14px"><u><strong>Towny Provinces</strong></u></span></h4>

<h4>An add-on plugin for Towny, which makes claiming more organized, reducing staff workload and server toxicity.</h4>

<p>Divides The Map Automatically into Provinces:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🎩 Civilised Provinces: 1 town only, no foreign outposts allowed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🌊 Sea Provinces: No towns, outposts allowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🏜️ Wasteland Provinces: No towns, outposts allowed</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solves</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 💸 Overclaiming: Each town has a reserved claiming area; No need to throw away money on overclaiming.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🚫 Claim Blocking: No town can block the claiming plans of another town.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🐍 Snake Claiming: Snake claiming is irrelevant.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🍩 Doughnut Claiming: Doughnut claiming is irrelevant.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🍔 Town Surrounding: A town cannot surrounded itself with another town (e.g. to become un-attackable).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🚷 Travel Blocking: Travel cannot be blocked by claims, because province borders are always wilderness.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⛺ Inactive towns in popular areas: Upkeep can be raised in popular regions, discouraging inactive towns.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🧜&zwj;♂️ Sea Peoples: Founding towns in the open sea can be prevented, if a server so chooses.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🎅 Hermits: Upkeep can be lowered in unpopular regions, supporting players with isolationist styles of play.</p>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9">The Plugin can be found </span><a href="https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/TownyProvinces"><span style="color:#2980b9">Here</span></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/TownyProvinces"><span style="color:#27ae60"><u><strong>Towny Cultures:</strong></u></span></a></p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">TownyCultures is an add-on plugin for Towny, which enables &quot;cultures&quot; on Towny servers.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Players that share a culture have their own &quot;chat&quot; channel.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Towns choose what culture they want to be a part of.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#27ae60"><strong><u>Features:</u></strong></span></p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Each town has a &#39;culture&#39; e.g. &quot;Greek&quot;, &quot;Celtic&quot;, &quot;Roman&quot;, &quot;Azurian&quot; etc.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Each town culture is displayed on the Town screen.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Town residents can communicate with all other town residents of the same culture (regardless of nation),<br />
    using the Culture Channel: <code>/cc &lt;message&gt;</code>.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Town culture is fluid and dynamic. There is no central administrator for each culture.<br />
    A new culture can be created by a mayor, using: <code>/town set culture &lt;culture&gt;</code>.<br />
    The same command can be used to join an existing culture.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Nations do not create or specify culture in this way.<br />
    Instead their culture is the sum of whichever cultures their component towns identify with,<br />
    and/or whichever culture(s) they might claim to be affiliated with.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Culture is important in war systems where town transfer-after-invasion is possible,<br />
    because although a town might be transferred to an enemy nation,<br />
    the residents can continue communicating with their friends in the same culture,<br />
    using the Culture Channel: <code>/cc &lt;message&gt;</code>.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Culture can be shown on your dynmap&#39; town popups.<br />
    Add %culture% in your Dynmap-Towny config&#39;s InfoWindow.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60">Culture can be shown using the placeholder: %townycultures_culture%</span></li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="color:#2980b9">Elitemobs Expansion/Updates of Dungeons</span></span></strong></u></p>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9"><span style="font-size:14px">a whole slew of new dungeon updates was planned to be released soon by the elitemobs teams, all the updates and any new dungeons will be added to the server.<br />
<br />
I also plan to make my own dungeons in the future, my own quest, etc. for elitemobs but that&#39;s for the future, it will only happen after I have relaunched the server and then only after I have fixed all the reported bugs I can. so about 3 months after launch we should be good and by that time I&#39;ll probably start leaking a few preview images or texts of what I plan to add. I already have a few Custom maps ready, they only need to be updated to include newer MC content, actual structures and then, of course, the elitemobs side of things, which will include new storylines.</span></span></p>

<h4><u><strong><span style="font-size:16px">Removed Features</span></strong></u><br />
<span style="color:#2980b9">Removed Discord Economy Bridge due to the gambling aspects in it being the only reason it was added, but unfortunately due to the updated Minecraft Eula and Mojang going after servers breaking the Eula, I don&#39;t want to take the chance and keep this on the server.</span></h4>

<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong>Griefdefender</strong></u> - Plain and simple, it&#39;s too complex and while it does have towny compatibility, the other plugins don&#39;t like that I&#39;m using 2 systems at the same time. I will be implementing a fix in towny that allows for people who want to be hermits.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong>Discord Economy Bridge</strong></u> - Technically goes against the Eula, but also because it was never really used and there are better alternatives, it is also going to become a useless plugin once the new profile system is in place.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4><u><strong><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:#2980b9">Updated/Overhauled Features</span></span></strong></u></h4>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong>New Custom Enchantments</strong></u></span></p>

</ul>

<p><u><strong><span style="color:#2980b9"><span style="font-family:'Verdana'">Economy Overhaul</span></span></strong></u></p>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9">The economy overhaul is planned, but I&#39;m looking into scrapping the system I planned and doing an entirely new one.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-size:16px"><u><strong>Possible Features - still being looked into</strong></u></span><br />
with how much I&#39;m integrating the different systems into each other and other updates that look small on the surface but are huge, I thought I would list a few features here which I might include later on after I do a bit more research on them and I have fleshed out the systems that they will interact with so I can see where they might cause issues, etc. Links are included in the plugin names.</h4>

<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><a href="https://geysermc.org/"><u><strong>GeyserMC</strong></u> </a>- in other words Bedrock edition compatibility, this one is going to be a huge project as it interacts with literally every system on the server.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong>Custom Foods</strong></u> -</span><span style="color:#27ae60"> I&#39;m looking into this and other custom systems to expand what&#39;s available and to make the server more immersive.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%AD%90-ultimatefireworks-%E2%AD%90-1-7-1-19.30201/"><u><strong>Ultimate Fireworks</strong></u></a></span><span style="color:#27ae60"> - An expansion on the fireworks systems that will be great for celebrations in the game.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60"><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E3%80%90better-explosions%E3%80%91-stunning-realistic-tnt-explosion-visuals-1-13-1-20-x.92653/"><u><strong>Better Explosions</strong></u></a> - Make explosions look better, performance-wise on the server I can cap it, so that should help there, my only issue is there is no way to turn this off for specific players, which is understandable, but it can mean there might be client-side performance issues with those that have weaker computers.</span></li>
    <li><u><strong><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/noteblockmusicplayer.37295/">Noteblock Music Player</a></strong></u> <span style="color:#27ae60">- Will be used for lobbies and I&#39;m still looking into if I can localise it, if I can localise the sound then I will be adding sound effects/music to battles.</span></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/townymusic.106049/"><u><strong>Towny Music</strong></u></a> <span style="color:#27ae60">- using this players will be able to add national/town anthems and create playlists for themselves for their plots if they want.</span></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/schematic-brush-reborn-2-schematic-pasting-reinvented.98499/"><u><strong>Schematic Brush Reborn 2</strong></u></a> and the <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/survivalschematicbrush-schematic-brush-reborn-2-add-on.102676/"><strong><u>Survival Schamtic Brush </u></strong></a><strong><u>Add-on </u></strong>- <span style="color:#27ae60">Using both normal players will be able to create/build schematics and use the tool to help them terraform terrain. but this will use blocks and tools from the player that executes the command&#39;s inventory to do this. I&#39;m planning on using this as one of the builder rank rewards.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60"><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fancycrafting.87300/"><strong><u>Fancy Crafting</u></strong></a> - Another way to craft and create items, I&#39;m looking into using this for all custom items that are not liquid maybe liquids will be included for some things, but most liquids will be using the brewery system for their creation.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60"><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/customdecentholograms.110861/"><u><strong>Custom Decent Holograms</strong></u></a> - Will allow players to create/manage Holograms on plots they own. (This is most likely going to pass)</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60"><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/towny-resource-packs.105579/"><u><strong>Towny Resource Packs</strong></u></a> - Please go look in the resource pack section, i mentioned what I want this to be used for there. too much to type and this is going to be an advanced system due to the server having its own resource pack.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60"><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bigbrother-free-ai-chatfilter-anti-vpn-anti-alt-extra-security.112372/"><strong><u>Big Brother</u></strong></a> - I&#39;m heavily considering it, it adds layers of security to the server and even for OP. which has had me concerned for a long time. I just need to check chat compatibility.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#27ae60"><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/pockethorses-1-13-1-20-%E2%9C%A8create-your-own-horses%E2%9C%A8-in-game-editor-modelengine-mysql-and-more.111158/"><u><strong>Pocket Horses</strong></u></a> - Finally we have horses where breeding counts towards something. - Need to await update, but creator is inactive...</span></li>

    <li><span style="color:#27ae60"><a href="https://github.com/aematsubara/RealisticVillagers"><u><strong>Realistic Villagers</strong></u></a> - Better Villagers</span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span style="font-size:16px"><u><strong>Thought about Features - Will never be Included</strong></u></span><br />
I thought about adding the following features but they either have too many bugs or will just add another of the same system to the server.</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4><u><strong>Auction houses</strong></u> - they are notorious for their duplication bugs and it&#39;ll be the third shop system... as we already have player shops on the server and then the server shop.</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><u><strong>The Profile System &amp; Website Revamp &amp; Chat Integration</strong></u></h2>

<p>The Profile system is complex and not completely planned out yet, but the idea is to create a unique player ID on the server side to link all your server-related accounts together. that would be your discord, MC, Dynmap, Plan and website account.</p>

<p>It will allow me and the future mod/admin team to handle rule breakers better and it&#39;ll also allow for better security when it comes to the accounts linked to the server. I&#39;m looking into adding 2-factor authentication to the website rewrite, but to use that to guard the dynmap and plan on the website as those are also planned to be integrated into the new website.</p>

<p>The website itself will have a profile page where you can see your own profile and it&#39;ll include settings to hide your progress from others. when I say progress, I mean it will show your current health as of when you were last online, hunger, defense, inventory, end chest inventory and your backpack inventory. it&#39;ll also show all your details that Plan shows, outside of certain details like player ip&#39;s and locations. and most of this will also be added to an in-game profile page in the menu system.</p>

<p>I plan on allowing it to also be previewed in Discord chat by a bot command, hence why it&#39;s all connected.</p>

<p>Now the website will be greatly expanded upon in the future as I plan on integrating the dynmap and Plan sites into the website while also adding the new profile system, I will be adding forums to the website alongside a wiki that will have all the server documentation on it. the forums I&#39;m still looking into if it is feasible and how many issues it would cause me to integrate the discord with it so that you can read the forums on both the website and here on the server. then I&#39;m also hoping to completely integrate the chat channels between the server, discord, dynmap and the website. but dynmap chat might be removed in favour of just having the chat linked to the website.</p>

<h2><u><strong>Rules, Punishments &amp; Staff Systems</strong></u></h2>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9">This is all still on hold, I know, I should finish this, but to tell you the truth, I&#39;m having a bit of an issue making up my mind on how this system should work, and what rules to add, as this system will govern literally the MC Server, the Discord Server and The Website. If any of you have ideas DM them to me.<br />
<br />
The furthest I got with planning this system was a three-strike system I wanted to implement... but that system idea had a few major holes in it since it would have been regarded as too harsh. right now I&#39;m doing research into seeing how major servers handle their punishment system and what rules they have and seeing if I can&#39;t create my own system. I also don&#39;t want admins, mods or any staff having too much power unless I trust them, but then agian I know I won&#39;t always be able to trust everyone so I&#39;m looking into restructuring the admin and mod system as well.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size:22px"><u><strong><span style="color:#2980b9">Discord Overhaul</span></strong></u></span></h2>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9">The Discord Overhaul is a large overhaul, I will be revising all the current channels on the discord to see if they should stay or if changes are needed, I will also be adding in brand new channels and you might see new ones pop up only for them to disappear after a small while. New roles will be added, etc For now, this will be to redesign the discord server alone, which means most of the extras I added will be removed and by extras, I mean the discord connection to both the website and server. they will be added back later on, but for now, I first want to get the structure of the discord server right before I add the extras agian.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Discord Roles</span></strong></u></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#2980b9">This is a basic version of the role layout it will change heavily in the future and a lot more information will be added once the new rules and punishment systems have been created.</span></p>

<ul>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><strong>Owner</strong> - Literally the Owners of the Discord/MC Server and Website. - Will focus mainly on developing and somewhat managing all three</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong>Council </strong></u>- The Council members are the heads of they&#39;re respective admin teams. there will be 3 admin teams, one for each platform, They handle most of the managerial work of the admin teams and are basically the decision-makers.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong>Admin</strong></u> - Their work is to manage their respective platforms all three platforms admin teams will have the same role on Discord. They will be the ones that look into open tickets and if needed provide support or elevate the issue to the council.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong>Moderator</strong></u> - Same as admin three teams one for each platform handling the grunt work of looking into issues and reporting them to admins.</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><strong>Member</strong></u> - Normal users of the discord server.</span></li>
</ul>
